# AES
My implementation of AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) Algorithm using a 256-bit key 

This repository aims to show my implementation of the AES algorithm with an example of a message encrypted using the algorithm.

# message.txt: 
An example plaintext message that is to be encrypted using AES.

# key.txt:
The key used in the AES algorithm. In this case the key is 256 bits long.

# encrypted.txt:
The AES-encrypted version of the example plaintext message in message.txt in hex string format.

# AES.py:
The Python code implementing the AES algorithm.
